# who gives the logged users, awk takes the first field from each line (i.e. the username).
# read prompts the user to give a username to delete
# su $name connects us as that usern then -c executes the command "kill -9 -1"
# 	meaning "kill option SIGKILL (-9) all processes except itself and init (-1), i.e. kill all processes
# 	(we can't delete a user actively using a process).
# userdel deletes the user.
