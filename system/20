# Listez tout les utilisateurs existants sur la machine [Commande]
compgen -u

# compgen = command that lists stuff such as available commads (-c), built-ins (-b), or indeed users (-u).
# Alternatively, we can look in the file that locally stores the users of the system with
# "cat /etc/passwd | awk -F ':' '{print $1}'"
