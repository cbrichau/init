----------------
Type: daemon

# Result of "ls /etc/init.d/" or "service --status-all".
# ----------
# 1) /etc/init.d/ = a directory that basically contains start/stop scripts to control (i.e. start,stop,restart,reload)
#    the machine's daemons during boot or while the system is running.
# 2) daemon = computer program that runs as a background process (rather than under the direct control of a user).
# 3) Services that start on boot must have daemons in init.d in folders named after themselves, e.g. "/etc/init.d/mydaemon".
# 4) The "service" command sort of calls the scripts in "/etc/init.d/".
#    E.g. "service mydaemon start" == "/etc/init.d/mydaemon start"
# ----------
# So ==>
# - "ls /etc/init.d/" prints a list of daemon names, which include names of services that automatically start on boot.
# - "service --status-all" gives the status of all scripts in init.d, effectively listing them in the process.
